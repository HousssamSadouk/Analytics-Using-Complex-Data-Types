In this project, I used SQL to perform geospatial analysis on a large dataset of location-based data. The dataset contained information about various points of interest, including their latitude and longitude coordinates, as well as other attributes such as category, rating, and reviews. The goal of the project was to use complex data types in SQL, such as geography and geometry, to perform advanced geospatial analysis and gain insights into the spatial relationships and patterns within the data.
