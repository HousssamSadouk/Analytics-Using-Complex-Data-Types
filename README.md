# Houssam Sadouk Portfolio
 
I'm glad to share with you my portfolio as a Data Scientist with a little experience in predictive modeling,data processing,and data mining algorithms,as well as scripting languages, Python, SQL,Spreadsheet,Power BI and more make me capable of creating,developing,testing,and deploying highly adaptive diverse services to translate business and functional qualifications into substantial deliverables.

I obtain my master degree in artificiel intelligence and IoT Innovation at the Hassania School Of Public, Casablanca. My master thesis defense was about « Forecast and optimization by using all models of machine learning and deep learning for goal to reduce electricity consumption by integrating an intelligent micro- grid in a medium-voltage establishment using energy management system. » Also i took my master’s degree in computer physics at Faculty of Science ,University Mohammed V Rabat , where throughout this course i did simulations and modeling of physical problems with the implementation of computer science. I am extremely interested in any similar post to continue my passion on developing research activities in several aspects of AI , data science and computer science.

###  [Build-Bank-Customers-Predictions](https://github.com/HousssamSadouk/Build-Bank-Customers-Predictions/blob/main/Bank.ipynb)
* We have a dataset that contains information about people that are using cards issued by a particular bank.it states out some of the characteristics of these people which includes family informations,marital status and how often and in what way are they using the bank issued cards.we will be using this dataset to predict the type of card a customer may issue.
* So we start off with building ML model we use a RandomForestClassifier model and train that model using the bank card datapoints.
* There is abundant information on how cards are being used by the people , but you might have to search some complex terms wich constitutes as columns in the dataset before you may start preprocessing the data.
