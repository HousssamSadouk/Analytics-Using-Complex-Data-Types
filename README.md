# [Project 1# in the renewable energy sector:Forecast and optimization by using all models of machine learning and deep learning for goal to reduce electricity consumption by integrating an intelligent micro- grid in a medium-voltage establishment using energy management system](https://github.com/HousssamSadouk/Forcasting_Microgrid)


I.Exploratory time series analysis with additive and multipocative methods for :
   
   1.Trend
 
   2.Level
   
   3.Seasonality
   
   4.Noise
   
II.Augmented Dickey-Fuller test suitable for time series
