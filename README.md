# Houssam Sadouk Portfolio
 
I'm glad to share with you my portfolio as a Data Scientist with a little experience in predictive modeling,data processing,and data mining algorithms,as well as scripting languages, Python, SQL,Spreadsheet,Power BI and more make me capable of creating,developing,testing,and deploying highly adaptive diverse services to translate business and functional qualifications into substantial deliverables.

I obtain my master degree in artificiel intelligence and IoT Innovation at the Hassania School Of Public, Casablanca. My master thesis defense was about « Forecast and optimization by using all models of machine learning and deep learning for goal to reduce electricity consumption by integrating an intelligent micro- grid in a medium-voltage establishment using energy management system. » Also i took my master’s degree in computer physics at Faculty of Science ,University Mohammed V Rabat , where throughout this course i did simulations and modeling of physical problems with the implementation of computer science. I am extremely interested in any similar post to continue my passion on developing research activities in several aspects of AI , data science and computer science.

###  [Petrol-Price-Forecasting-Using-Auto-Keras](https://github.com/HousssamSadouk/Petrol-Price-Forecasting-Using-Auto-Keras/blob/main/Petrol%20Price%20Forecasting.ipynb)
* Main aim of this project is to predict and forecast the correct oil/petrol prices for the upcoming dates using ML techniques and Auto ML.
* We know that petrol prices are going up continously these days and it has become very hard to predict what will be the price range in the next few months or even days.
* So in this project we will try to forecast the different petrol prices for the upcoming dates given to us ,also we will use LSTM and ARIMA forecasting models to predict the prices then we will see how we can implement the same using Auto-Keras.
* what is an auto ML library who enables developpers with limited ML expertise to train high-quality models specific to their business needs.
* Timeline of the project.

###  [Build-Bank-Customers-Predictions](https://github.com/HousssamSadouk/Build-Bank-Customers-Predictions/blob/main/Bank.ipynb)
* We have a dataset that contains information about people that are using cards issued by a particular bank.it states out some of the characteristics of these people which includes family informations,marital status and how often and in what way are they using the bank issued cards.we will be using this dataset to predict the type of card a customer may issue.
* So we start off with building ML model we use a RandomForestClassifier model and train that model using the bank card datapoints.
* There is abundant information on how cards are being used by the people , but you might have to search some complex terms wich constitutes as columns in the dataset before you may start preprocessing the data.

### [Forest-Fire-Prediction](https://github.com/HousssamSadouk/Forest-Fire-Prediction/blob/main/Forest%20Fires.ipynb)
* Forest, bush or vegetation , can be described as any uncontrolled and non-prescribed combustion or burning of plants in a natural setting such as forest , grassland.we will not determining if a forest fire will take place or not , we are predicting the confidence of the forest fire based on some attributes.
* so we start off with building a ML model using RandomForestRegression model and train that model using the dataset.
* For this project you will also see RandomSearchCV in action and how we have implemented it.
