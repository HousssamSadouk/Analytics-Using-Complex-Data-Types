# Houssam Sadouk Portfolio
 
I'm glad to share with you my portfolio as a Data Scientist with experience in building data-intensive applications,overcoming complex architectural,and scalability issues in diverse industries.Proficient in predictive modeling,data processing,and data mining algorithms,as well as scripting languages, including Python ,R and Java and more. Capable of creating,developing,testing,and deploying highly adaptive diverse services to translate business and functional qualifications into susbstantial deliverables. 


I obtain my master degree in artificiel intelligence and IoT Innovation at the Hassania School Of Public, Casablanca. My master thesis defense was about « Forecast and optimization by using all models of machine learning and deep learning for goal to reduce electricity consumption by integrating an intelligent micro- grid in a medium-voltage establishment using energy management system. » Also i took my master’s degree in computer physics at Faculty of Science ,University Mohammed V Rabat , where throughout this course i did simulations and modeling of physical problems with the implementation of computer science. I am extremely interested in any similar post to continue my passion on developing research activities in several aspects of AI , data science and computer science.
